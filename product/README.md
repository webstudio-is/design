# This document covers how to contribute to the Webstudio Builder UI design.

## Webstudio Design Files

Our design system and component library lives here in the [Webstudio Library](https://www.figma.com/file/sfCE7iLS0k25qCxiifQNLE/%F0%9F%93%9A-Webstudio-Library?type=design&node-id=2647%3A10046&mode=design&t=D3OMdUnCjvXF1DpS-1)

Our feature designs and documentation are here in the [Webstudio Design Docs](https://www.figma.com/file/xCBegXEWxROLqA1Y31z2Xo/%F0%9F%93%96-Webstudio-Design-Docs?type=design&node-id=234%3A36754&mode=design&t=lLTAVhpeQeepQoOq-1)

## Contribute to Webstudio's UI Design

1. Open the Library and Docs files above and copy them to your personal Figma account. We do not allow edit access to our design files but you can duplicate them in order to use our design assets.
2. Familiarize yourself with the design system by exploring the docs. Start with the first page of the Design Docs file, named "Component Docs".
3. Start a discussion by creating a github issue [here](https://github.com/webstudio-is/webstudio-design/issues). This is where you can describe your design suggestions, post links or screenshots of your design experiments, and the team can discuss with you and provide feedback. Design at Webstudio is a collaborative effort.
